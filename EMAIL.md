even if I have a full indie-web enabled website, with all my own content created in one place, possible broadcasting to silos, with perfect integration and security, all looking very pretty. What do I hope to achieve?

A noddy badge for each of:
- One less person's data to exploit? 
- One more example of an indie-webber?
- A drive-by site for other geeks, but no real value?
- A cost, because I'm self-hosting.
- A whole lot of wasted time.
...because essentially - who cares?

The best thing I can do right now with my time:
- business site: testimonials and a list of stuff I can do for money
- private site: nothing - it looks fine.

**LIKE:** I'd like for all my creativity to happen in one place, though. Long form, and short utterances. And photos. And from a single mobile app.
